Although it was very calm, we wanted to end the season with the Roxen Race. The original course was shortened due to the wind conditions.

Eight boats were competing - and we were the last to finish:

1. Bo Rogalin with **Mustang jr**
1. Björn Hofström with **Mustang jr**
1. Team Ö & Ö with **IF**
1. Roger Björegren with **Mustang jr**
1. Toivo Mielonen with **Fenix**
1. Mårten Lundgren with **Mustang jr**
1. Henrik Abrahamsson with **Maxi Racer**
1. Lennart Ochel with **Comfortina 32**
