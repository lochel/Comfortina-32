I use [OpenCPN](https://opencpn.org/) as chart plotter navigation software on a Raspberry Pi. Unfortunatly I couldn't find any good enough charts on the web. So I decided to scan the paper charts. This requires to reference the scanned charts and to convert them into a file format that can be imported by OpenCPN.

This can be done with the free software [**imgkap**](https://github.com/nohal/imgkap).
